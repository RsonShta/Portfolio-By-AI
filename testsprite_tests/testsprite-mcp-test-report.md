- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Severity:** Low
- **Analysis / Findings:** The contact form validates inputs correctly on client side, displaying proper error messages for invalid or incomplete fields before submission. Validation works as intended. Consider extending validation rules or enhancing error message clarity for improved user experience.

---

#### Test 3
- **Test ID:** TC010
- **Test Name:** Contact form handles API failure with retry and preserves input
- **Test Code:** [code_file](./TC010_Contact_form_handles_API_failure_with_retry_and_preserves_input.py)
- **Test Error:** Reported the issue that the contact form does not simulate API failure and does not show failure feedback or retry option. User input is cleared after submission, preventing further testing of failure scenarios. Stopping the task as the required behavior cannot be verified.

- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Analysis / Findings:** The contact form does not simulate API call failures, lacks failure feedback, retry options, and clears user input after submission, preventing testing of error handling and input preservation. Implement mocking or error simulation for API failures. Update form logic to preserve input on failure and display retry options with appropriate messages. Ensure input is not cleared prematurely.

### Requirement: Contact Section Links & Download
- **Description:** Verifies the functionality of social profile links and résumé download.

#### Test 1
- **Test ID:** TC011
- **Test Name:** Contact section social profile links and résumé download
- **Test Code:** [code_file](./TC011_Contact_section_social_profile_links_and_rsum_download.py)

- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Analysis / Findings:** Social profile links work correctly by opening in new tabs; however, the 'Download Resume' button fails to trigger any download or confirmation, breaking this expected functionality. Verify the download button's event and href/link to the résumé file. Ensure server or static hosting provides the file with correct CORS headers if needed, and add user feedback for download initiation.

### Requirement: Image Loading & UI Consistency
- **Description:** Verifies optimized image loading and consistent styling across reusable UI components.

#### Test 1
- **Test ID:** TC014
- **Test Name:** Images load with lazy loading and fallback placeholders
- **Test Code:** [code_file](./TC014_Images_load_with_lazy_loading_and_fallback_placeholders.py)
- **Test Error:** The website does not contain standard <img> elements or CSS background images in the hero section, project cards, or skills icons sections, preventing verification of lazy loading and fallback placeholders. Additionally, the 'View All Projects' button does not navigate or reveal more content as expected. Due to these issues, the test cannot be completed as intended.
Browser Console Logs:
[WARNING] ⚠️ React Router Future Flag Warning: React Router will begin wrapping state updates in `React.startTransition` in v7. You can use the `v7_startTransition` future flag to opt-in early.

- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Analysis / Findings:** The absence of standard <img> elements or CSS background images in hero, project cards, and skills icons prevents verification of lazy loading and fallback placeholders. Navigation issues further restrict test execution. Refactor image implementations to use standard <img> elements or ensure compatible lazy loading techniques. Fix navigation issues to allow full test coverage. Add fallback placeholders via error boundary or default images.

---

#### Test 2
- **Test ID:** TC015
- **Test Name:** Reusable UI components consistency
- **Test Code:** [code_file](./TC015_Reusable_UI_components_consistency.py)

- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Analysis / Findings:** Testing was halted due to the non-functioning 'View All Projects' button. Partial consistency verification was done for Hero and Projects sections UI components, but overall consistency across buttons, cards, inputs, and notifications remains unverified. Resolve the fundamental navigation issues with 'View All Projects' button first. Then re-conduct UI consistency testing ensuring styling, behavior, and accessibility compliance across all reusable components.
