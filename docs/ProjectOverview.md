## Portfolio Project — Overview, Features & Behavior

### Purpose

This portfolio website showcases a developer's skills, projects, and contact details. It is designed to convey competence through a fast, accessible, and visually polished single-page experience that highlights work samples, technical skills, and a clear call-to-action for contacting or hiring.

### Audience

- Prospective employers and clients
- Recruiters and technical leads
- Fellow developers evaluating design and implementation choices

### High-level goals

- Present projects with context, visuals, and links to source/live demos
- Communicate technical skills and tooling clearly
- Provide an easy way to contact the owner
- Load quickly on mobile and desktop
- Be accessible and responsive

### Core Features

1. Hero section

   - Full-bleed hero with engaging background image / animated background.
   - Short blurb about the developer and primary call-to-action (view projects / contact).

2. Projects section

   - Cards or tiles for each project with image, short description, tech tags, and links (repo / live demo).
   - Filter or category tags (optional) to sort projects by technology or type.

3. Skills section

   - Visual representation of skill categories (frontend, backend, tools) and competency levels (icons, bars, or chips).

4. Contact section

   - Contact form (name, email, message) with validation and clear success/failure states.
   - Links to email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and résumé download.

5. Animated / background visuals

   - Subtle, performant animated background component that enhances but does not distract (prefers reduced-motion).

6. Responsive navigation

   - Sticky or accessible navbar with anchor links to page sections and a mobile-friendly menu.

7. Accessibility and performance

   - Keyboard focus, semantic HTML, aria labels where needed, color contrast checks.
   - Images optimized, lazy-loading for project images, minimal JS for first paint.

8. Small UI utilities and components
   - Reusable UI primitives (buttons, cards, inputs, toasts) consistent across the site.

### How it should work (behavioral flows)

1. First load

   - Fast paint of hero and navigation. Animated background starts but respects prefers-reduced-motion.
   - Main content (projects, skills, contact) can be scrolled to via navbar anchors.

2. Viewing a project

   - Click a project card to either open a modal with project details or navigate to a project detail route.
   - Modal contains a larger screenshot, description, tech list, links, and optionally a short demo or carousel.

3. Contact submission

   - Form validates inputs client-side. On submit, show an inline loader and then a toast confirming success or error.
   - If using a serverless/email API, ensure errors are gracefully surfaced and can be retried.

4. Navigation and deep linking

   - Section anchors update the URL hash so links can target sections.
   - Deep links load at the correct scroll position and the page should be accessible when loaded directly.

5. Mobile behaviour
   - Collapsible mobile nav.
   - Project cards stack vertically with touch-friendly targets.

### Data & technical assumptions

- Tech stack observed in this workspace: Vite, React (TSX), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- Projects are static content driven by a lightweight data file (JSON/TS export) or MDX.
- Contact form can post to a serverless function, form service, or mailto fallback.

If you want, I can add a small JSON schema or content file to hold the projects and wire a detail modal.

### Acceptance criteria (how we know it's done)

- Homepage loads under 2s on a typical 3G emulated mobile connection (or a clear plan to optimize).
- All interactive elements reachable and operable by keyboard.
- Contact form returns a success state and an error state when the API fails.
- Projects render consistently across breakpoints and open details on click.

### Edge cases & error handling

- Empty projects list: show a friendly placeholder and a note that more projects are coming.
- Contact API failure: show retry CTA and copy the message locally so the user can try again.
- Image load failures: use fallback images or placeholders.

### Small actionable next steps (suggested)

1. Create a `data/projects.ts` (or JSON) containing project metadata.
2. Implement a reusable `ProjectCard` and `ProjectModal` in `src/components/`.
3. Add client-side validation to the contact form and wire a serverless endpoint or form service.
4. Run Lighthouse and fix highest-impact performance and accessibility issues.

Requirements coverage

- "make a document for my portfolio project's features, purpose, and how it should work": Done — added this `docs/ProjectOverview.md` with purpose, features, behavior, acceptance criteria, and next steps.

If you'd like changes (tone, level of detail, or export to PDF/README), tell me which format and I'll update it.
